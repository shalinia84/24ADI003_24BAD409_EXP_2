Scenario 1 – Ocean Water Temperature Prediction:

Dataset (Kaggle – Public): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi

This experiment focuses on predicting ocean water temperature (T_degC) using the CalCOFI dataset and a Linear Regression model. Environmental and depth-related features such as depth, salinity, oxygen, latitude, and longitude are used as input variables. The workflow includes data loading, missing value imputation, feature scaling, train–test splitting, model training, and evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R² score. Model performance is further improved using feature selection and regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression.

Scenario 2 – LIC Stock Price Movement Classification:

Dataset (Kaggle – Public): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashis74017/lic-stock-price-data

This experiment aims to classify whether the LIC stock price will increase or decrease using historical stock market data. A binary target variable is created based on opening and closing prices, and features such as open, high, low, and volume are used to train a Logistic Regression model. The process includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Model optimization is performed through hyperparameter tuning and regularization, along with visualization of the ROC curve and feature importance.
